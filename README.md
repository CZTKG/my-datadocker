# my-datadocker

dockerfile for the my-datascience-app

git init folder (empty or not)
git remote add origin (github link, make on github first)
git remote -v to view
git status to check
git add, git commit, etc.
git push origin master

(note, here i actually had to use master, since my branch was called master not main on main computer)

ok it actually failed, because the size was too large. theory and steps were good though

going to make it a google drive link.
